> It's like how you write an experiment in science. **Aim**(formulate the question), **Apparatus**, **Theory**, (gather information), **Procedure**(apply information), **Observations**(consider the implications), **precautions/sources of error**(explore other points of view).

As others are likely to have already pointed out -- this wonderful 5-step approach is slightly different from the Scientific Method (but shares a lot of important similarities). The scientific method, of course, is:

1. Make an observation
2. Formulate a question
3. Narrow the question to a testable hypothesis
4. Do your research (either through experimentation or gathering information)
5. Analyse the data and come to a conclusion (while being critical of alternative approaches).

Honestly, everyone benefits from such a systemic approach to understanding information. We're today at a point in civilisation where intelligence is no longer defined by how much we know, but by how much information we can process. Critical thinking is today more essential than ever before.
Here's a tip; be skeptical of people you disagree with, but even more skeptical with people you agree with.

1. Formulate your question
2. Gather your information
3. Apply the information
4. Consider the implications
5. Explore other points of view

### 15 Questions to Encourage Critical Thinking

>(https://www.hunschool.org/resources/questions-for-critical-thinking)

What is one of the best ways to encourage critical thinking? By asking excellent questions! 

We have compiled a list of 15 questions that you, as a teacher or parent, can ask to encourage kids to think outside the box. Let's dive in.

1. HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS? 

Whether it was by word of mouth, classroom knowledge, or a news report, this question prompts students to consider whether their source of information is reputable.

2. HOW WOULD YOUR PERSPECTIVE BE DIFFERENT IF YOU WERE ON THE OPPOSING SIDE?

This question encourages kids to role-play from an opposing person’s viewpoint and discover a perspective outside their own so that they can better understand the broader situation. Extracurriculars like debate class — mandatory for all Hun middle school students — is a powerful way to accomplish this goal, as students must thoughtfully anticipate their opposition's arguments in order to counter them.

3. HOW WOULD YOU SOLVE THIS PROBLEM?

Finding creative solutions to common problems is a valuable life skill. This question is the perfect opportunity to encourage young minds to wander!

4. DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE — AND WHY?

Choosing a side in any debate challenges students to consider both perspectives, weigh the arguments, and make an informed choice. 

5. WHY? WHY? WHY?

Just like when you were a young kid, ask why repeatedly to push students beyond a simple first, second, or even third answer, to get to the real depth. Be careful, though, not to ask them to the point of frustration — you want learning and exploring to be a positive experience.

6. HOW COULD WE AVOID THIS PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE?

Ask students to apply critical thinking by analyzing how they could prevent a certain issue from reoccurring.

7. WHY DOES IT MATTER?

Whether they're learning about a historical event or a mathematical concept, it's important to understand why the topic is relevant today.

8. WHAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE?

It can be easy to learn one worldview and automatically believe it is the only, or the best, way. Challenging kids to think of a creative alternate perspective encourages them to think more broadly.

9. CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE?

Inventing an example, or pulling from experience to share a real one, is an excellent way to apply critical thinking skills.

10. HOW COULD IT HAVE ENDED DIFFERENTLY?

It takes some innovation and careful analysis to storyboard a different ending, considering "what could have been" rather than "what is." 

11. WHEN WILL WE BE ABLE TO TELL IF IT WORKED?

Kids will be pushed to consider what constitutes success and how it can be measured in scenarios where the results aren't set in stone.

12. WHY DID YOU ASK THAT QUESTION?

Instead of answering a question at face value, this question encourages kids to think about what the merits of the question may be.

13. WHO WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS?

Students as the next generation of leaders and game-changers. When making any decision, it's important to consider who will be impacted and how.

14. WHAT CAN THIS STORY TEACH US ABOUT OUR OWN LIVES?

From literature to social studies, students interact with all kinds of different stories. Help them take these narratives one step further by examining how it relates to their lives.

15. WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM?

Analyzing why something is a problem — rather than just accepting that it is — will help students develop strong problem-solving skills of their own.
